# Exploring the Influence of State Dependency on Regime Preferences in Post-Communist Europe and Central Asia
## Summary
In this research project, I replicate and extend the analysis presented in the book Autocratic Middle Class (Rosenfled, 2020),  which investigates the influence of state dependency on the demand for democracy in post-communist Europe and Eurasia. My focus is on the book's third chapter, which offers a cross-national examination of the regime preferences of the post-communist middle class. By replicating the author's study, I demonstrate that the middle class's demand for democracy is more contingent than previously believed, with increased support for democracy observed only among those employed in the private sector in non-democratic states. Furthermore, I expand the scope of analysis to include individuals exhibiting the greatest reliance on the state, such as those receiving unemployment and disability benefits, social assistance, and welfare transfers. My findings indicate that among various socio-economic groups, those receiving state assistance are the least likely to support democracy as a regime, thereby providing a deeper understanding of the relationship between state dependency and democratic preferences.
## Data
In this study, I utilize data from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's (EBRD) Life in Transition Survey (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. (2006). Life in Transition Survey (LiTS). Retrieved from https://rb.gy/51rgv), conducted in early 2006. The dataset comprises nearly 27,000 individual observations across 27 countries from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. This unique dataset includes information on both employment history and regime preferences.

For the purpose of our analysis, I divide the data into two sub-samples: democratic countries 
(N = 18) and non-democratic countries (N = 9). The democratic countries in the sample include Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and Ukraine. Non-democratic countries consist of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.

While the original study's author does not explicitly state the index or method used for classifying the countries, my research indicates that the classification aligns with the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index (Economist Intelligence Unit. (2006). Democracy Index. Retrieved from https://rb.gy/8t1h1). The democratic sub-sample encompasses full democracies and flawed democracies, while the non-democratic sub-sample includes hybrid and authoritarian regimes. Notably, Georgia and Ukraine were classified as hybrid regimes by the Economist Democracy Index in 2006. However, the author acknowledges that these countries were on the cusp of democracy and includes them in the democratic sub-sample; I follow the same approach in my analysis.
